**Version:** 0.1

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Purpose of the Document
This document describes the requirements for the “bootstrap” system — a set of tools and artifacts for a reproducible and highly trusted initial bootstrapping process under the RISC-V architecture, including early-stage builds, image generation, and execution in QEMU/on hardware.

### 1.2 Scope
The SRS covers functional and non-functional requirements for:
- The builder pipeline (as of version 0.1 — stage1; stage2 planned later);
- Image generation (ELF → BIN, firmware, memory map);
- Execution environments (QEMU virt, Lichee Pi 4A, etc.);
- Verification (tests, hashes, reproducibility);
- Documentation and UX (CLI, logs, build artifacts).

### 1.3 Definitions and Abbreviations
- **Bootstrap** — the process of building a minimal trusted foundation of tools/software “from nothing/minimum.”
- **Stage-N** — a numbered stage in the build chain (stage1 builds stage2, etc.).
- **TE (Trusted Environment)** — a trusted execution/build environment.
- **QEMU** — an architecture emulator used for testing.
- **ELF** — Executable and Linkable Format.
- **HEX0/...** — minimalist formats/tools for early stages.

---

## 2. Stakeholders
- **Student developers:** implement and maintain the pipeline, reproduce results, and improve it.  
- **Supervisors/Instructors:** validate requirements and perform acceptance checks.

---

## 3. System Description

### 3.1 Context
The system builds a trusted chain of tools and artifacts, allowing to:
1) Build early stages with minimal means;  
2) Build higher-level toolsets;  
3) Build a target image and run it (QEMU/hardware).

### 3.2 Constraints and Assumptions
- Target: **RISC-V 64-bit (rv64)**.
- Only an agreed set of external tools may be used in early stages (e.g., **`riscv64-unknown-elf-gcc vZ`**).
- **Build reproducibility is mandatory** (fixed versions and hashes).

---

## 4. Use Cases

### UC-01: Quick local build and run in QEMU
**Actor:** developer  
**Goal:** obtain an image and verify that early stages initialize.  
**Main flow:**
1. Run `make qemu`.  
2. The system builds the stages and produces ELF/BIN.  
3. QEMU starts; boot logs are visible in the console.  
**Acceptance criteria:** the command completes without errors.

### UC-02: Build reproducibility check
**Actor:** instructor/CI  
**Goal:** two consecutive builds produce identical artifact hashes.  
**Acceptance criteria:** **SHA256** of all key artifacts match.

## 5. Functional Requirements (FR)

**Numbering rules:**  
`BLD-REQ-###` — build/pipeline;  
`IMG-REQ-###` — images/formats;  
`RUN-REQ-###` — execution/platforms;  
`VER-REQ-###` — verification/tests;  
`DOC-REQ-###` — documentation/UX.

### 5.1 Build/Pipeline
- **BLD-REQ-001:** The system must provide a `make all` target that performs the full cycle: stage1 → stage2 → toolchain subset → image.

### 5.2 Images and Formats
- **IMG-REQ-001:** The system must be able to convert ELF to BIN with a fixed entry point at `0x08048000`.
- **IMG-REQ-002:** The memory map (segments, addresses, alignment) must be documented.

### 5.3 Execution
- **RUN-REQ-001:** The `make qemu` command must run the image using `qemu-system-riscv64 -machine virt -bios` with UART0 console.
- **RUN-REQ-002:** (Optional) Payload generation for Lichee Pi 4A must be supported.

### 5.4 Documentation and UX
- **DOC-REQ-001:** The README must provide a “5-minute quick start”: dependencies, `make all`, `make qemu`.
- **DOC-REQ-002:** Each stage must have a brief page describing: purpose, inputs/outputs, and readiness criteria.

---

## 6. Non-Functional Requirements (NFR)

### 6.1 Performance
- **NFR-PERF-001:** Full build for QEMU must take no more than 1 minute on a machine with 4 CPU cores and 8 GB RAM.

### 6.2 Reliability/Reproducibility
- **NFR-REP-001:** Two consecutive builds in a clean environment must produce identical SHA256 hashes for key artifacts.
- **NFR-LOG-001:** All build errors must include a code and a reference to the stage.

### 6.3 Portability
- **NFR-PORT-001:** Linux x86_64 and WSL2 must be supported.

### 6.4 Security/Trust
- **NFR-SEC-001:** The list of external binary dependencies must be minimal and version/hash-locked.

---

## 7. Interfaces

### 7.1 CLI
- `make all | clean | qemu | verify | hashes`  
- Environment variables: `CROSS_COMPILE`, `RISCV_PREFIX`, `PLATFORM=qemu|lpi4a`, etc.

### 7.2 File Formats
- ELF (input), BIN (output), MAP (memory map), LOG (logs).  
- Mapping table: segment → address → size (see Appendix A).

### 7.3 Hardware/Emulator
- QEMU virt: UART0 @115200 8N1; memory — 128 MB.

---

## 8. Acceptance Criteria

- All FR/NFR are satisfied; UC-01 and UC-02 are passed.  
- README is validated on a “clean” machine (acting as reviewer).  
- Artifact hashes are stable across two independent hosts.

---

## 9. Risks and Assumptions
- Risk: differences in QEMU/linker versions may cause hash mismatches.  
- Mitigation: version lock files/containerization.  
- Assumption: a minimal cross-compiler is available (assumes `riscv64-unknown-elf-gcc`). Stage0 is not implemented within this project.

---

## 10. Release Plan and Readiness Metrics
- **M1:** Basic builder + `make qemu`.  
- **M2:** Documented memory map + hash verification.  
- **M3:** Launch on Lichee Pi 4A hardware after QEMU stabilization.  
- **Metrics:** % of FR covered, hash stability, build time.
